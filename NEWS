# All changes to networkD3 are documented here.

## Version 0.2.9

- `forceNetwork` now allows you to supply a vector of colours to the
`linkColour`argument. This enables the user to highlight links to specific
nodes. Thanks to Garth Tarr. 

- Minor documentation improvements.

## Version 0.2.8

- Added `NodeGroup` and `LinkGroup` parameters to `sankeyNetwork` so links
can be colourised. Thanks to Edwin de Jonge.

- `fontFamily` is now applied to legends in `forceNetwork`. Thanks to Casey
Shannon.

- Improved bounding behaviour with `forceNetwork`. Now bounds both the links and
nodes. Thanks to Koba Khitalishvili.

## Version 0.2.7

- Fixed an issue with sankey viewBox sizing.

## Version 0.2.6

- `sankeyNetwork` fully supports cycles

- `sankeyNetwork` gets same responsive sizing and better fitting introduced
in 0.2.4 for `diagonalNetwork` and `radialNetwork`.

- `sankeyNetwork` gets same full margin control introduced
in 0.2.4 for `diagonalNetwork` and `radialNetwork`.

## Version 0.2.5

- Added `chordDiagram` to show directed relationships among entities.

## Version 0.2.4

- More robust margin argument for `diagonalNetwork` and `radialNetwork` allows
for a single value or specification of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` by
named `vector` or `list`.

- Responsive sizing using the `viewBox` attribute of `svg` for `diagonalNetwork`
and `radialNetwork` should allow for fitting in the container with no fiddling.

## Version 0.2.3

- Internal improvements to reduce dependencies: no longer depends on RCurl,
plyr, and rjson.

- Updated examples:

  + Using jsonlite makes JSONtoDF obsolete with the `fromJSON` function.

  + All Github data links now use the CDN link from
  [rawgit](https://rawgit.com/), so the examples  should be more inline with
  Github raw policies.

## Version 0.2.2

- `sankeyNetwork` changes:

    + Removes forced font family in favor of inherited from css or specified
    through the `fontFamily` argument.

    + Fixes issue with backslashes in the label for links.

    + Puts unicode right arrow in the tooltip.
    Adds argument to specify units for the tooltip label.

    + Handles cycles by updating this forked repo: <https://github.com/soxofaan/d3-plugin-captain-sankey>.

    + Makes assumptions that `Source` is column 1 and `Target` is column 2 if
    not provided.

## Version 0.2.1

- Fixed an issue with `forceNetwork` on Firefox. Thanks to @agoldst.

- Fixed an issue where `forceNetwork` node size would not return to
default after mouseover. Thanks to Pascal Pernot.

## Version 0.2

- Added `dendroNetwork` to create hierarchical cluster network diagrams
(dendrograms).

- `treeNetwork` is DEPRECATED.

- Placed functionality from `treeNetwork` to `radialNetwork`. The new
`radialNetwork` function has the same functionality, but has been renamed to be
more accurately descriptive and avoid confusion with `dendroNetwork`.

- Added `diagonalNetwork`, which creates tree network diagrams using diagonal
instead of radial nodes.

Thanks to Jonathan Owen.

## Version 0.1.8

- Added `clickAction` argument to `forceNetwork` to allow the user to
pass a JavaScript expression through to be activated on click of a node.
Thanks to Peter Ellis.

- Added `bounded` argument to `forceNetwork` to allow the user to create a
bounding box for the plot. See http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1129492.
Thanks to Charles Sese.

- Added `fontFamily` argument to `forceNetwork`, `simpleNetwork`,
`sankeyNetwork`, and `treeNetwork`. Thanks to Peter Ellis.

- Added `opacityNoHover` argument to `forceNetwork` to set the opacity of node
labels when nodes are not hovered over. Thanks to Peter Ellis.

## Version 0.1.7

- Include `JS` from htmlwidgets, to make it easier for users to pass arbitrary
JS to more arguments.

- Other internal code and documentation improvements.

## Version 0.1.6

- `fontSize` used for all functions rather than `fontsize`. Thank you to
@Hunter-Github for spotting this inconsistency.

## Version 0.1.5

- Minor improvement to treeNetwork documentation.
Thanks to Steven Beaupré and MrFlick.

## Version 0.1.4

- `forceNetwork` gains three new arguments.

    + `legend` allows you to add a node colour legend.

    + `radiusCalculation` and `Nodesize` allow you to vary node radius by
some values.

Thank you to Charles Sese for these additions.

## Version 0.1.3

- `zoom` argument added to `simpleNetwork` and `forceNetwork` to allow zooming.
Thanks to @timelyportfolio.

- Updated `treeNetwork` URL.

## Version 0.1.2.2

- Update link in `forceNetwork` example.

## Version 0.1.2.1

Enhanced flexibility when using data frames manipulated with dplyr/data.table.
Thanks to Kevin Kuo.

## Version 0.1.2

- Minor internal correction to d3.js version number.

## Version 0.1.1

- `treeNetwork` added allowing the user to create tree networks. Thanks to
B.W. Lewis.

- Upgrade to d3.js version 3.5.2.

## Version 0.1

- `sankeyNetwork` added.

- `colourScale` argument added to `forceNetwork` and `sankeyNetwork` to allow
the user to change the node colour scale.
