# All changes to networkD3 are documented here.


## Version 0.2

- Added `clusterNetwork` to create hierarchical cluster network diagrams.

- `treeNetwork` is DEPRECATED.

- Placed functionality from `treeNetwork` to `radialNetwork` and
`diagonalNetwork`. The new function has the same functionality, but has been
renamed to be more accurately descriptive and avoid confusion with
`clusterNetwork`.

Thanks to Jonathan Owen.

## Version 0.1.8

- Added `clickAction` argument to `forceNetwork` to allow the user to
pass a JavaScript expression through to be activated on click of a node.
Thanks to Peter Ellis.

- Added `bounded` argument to `forceNetwork` to allow the user to create a
bounding box for the plot. See http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1129492.
Thanks to Charles Sese.

- Added `fontFamily` argument to `forceNetwork`, `simpleNetwork`,
`sankeyNetwork`, and `treeNetwork`. Thanks to Peter Ellis.

- Added `opacityNoHover` argument to `forceNetwork` to set the opacity of node
labels when nodes are not hovered over. Thanks to Peter Ellis.

- Include `JS` from htmlwidgets, to make it easier for users to pass arbitrary
JS to more arguments.
